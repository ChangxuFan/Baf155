About dead symlinks:
* R_scFanc and R_liteRnaSeqFanc links to the /R directory you can download from the corresponding repositories for these R packages, as mentioned above.
* Other dead symlinks point to large files/directories that github cannot handle. But you can generate them by running the code.
